## Getting Started
The project has no version to test yet. You can fork the project and pull it in your computer to have a full access to the files.

# Requirements
The project is using [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), so you should take a look to them.
Also, you can create a [Trello](https://trello.com/) account as we will use this tool to stay organized.
