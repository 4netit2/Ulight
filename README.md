# Udacity Team Project
A CSS/ JavaScript Framework to add some original style to the web pages.


## Getting Started
The project has no version to test yet. You can fork the project and pull it in your computer to have a full access to the files.

# Requirements
The project is using <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, so you should take a look to them.
Also, you can create a <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> account as we will use this tool to stay organized.
