# Ulight

Welcome to the **Ulight Project**!

Here, we are making a Framework and a website for this Framework!

**Ulight** is a **CSS/ JavaScript Framework** to style original websites.


## The Framework

Ulight allows Front-End Developer to build original websites. **It breaks the rules and the standards of the website to let the developers express their creativity!**

Ulight will propose a large library of set of designed elements that developers should use to style their own HTML files. By using classes, developers will be able to access to that library and should choose the design of their choice.

## The Website

Ulight also needs a website! To present the project and allow web designer to propose new set of designed element to integrate to the Framework.

## How can I contribute?

Ulight is an Open Source project build by a team of Recipient of the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship 2017 - 2018 for Front-End Developer path (Europe).

What does it mean?

It means we are all beginners and hungry to learn! If this definition suits you, welcome!
