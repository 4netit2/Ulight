# udacity-team-project
An Open Source Project for Udacity Students

Hi everybody!

Regarding the discussion in this thread https://discussions.udacity.com/t/fire-digging-your-way-out-of-tutorial-hell-fire/4685492 I open this topic to propose you an OpenSource Project!

I couldn’t wait this evening to share my idea with you and to start the Brainstorm about it!

WHY AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT?
As we are mainly new in coding in this community, it could be hard to propose our help to an existing OpenSource project. It is scary and we often feel we don’t have the level to do it.
But, participating in an OpenSource project is a great way to learn, share and contribute.
As we are an ACTUAL community working together for more than 3 weeks, I think it could be great to start a project altogether! Because we know we are learning, we won’t be judged, and we know a bit each other!

IDEA
I propose to you to build a Bootstrap like project, but for more creative purposes.
What does it mean?
I really like Bootstrap3, but I feel it is giving us too many standards. All the websites looks a bit the same because they follow the same set of rules.

So I had the idea of a Framework with the same purpose of Bootstrap, but where we should add more possibilities to the user.
For example, we could let the choice to use a grid of 2, 4, 5, 10, 12, 16 and so on, instead of just the basic 12 columns grid.

But the main idea is to propose THEMES to the user.
In Bootstrap, there are some predefined styles for buttons, tables, lists etc., they are chosen following the web main standards. But what if we propose to add themes?

Some people should propose web designs, or simple themes to integrate into the Framework. With a certain style for the buttons, the blocks, the headers and so on. And it should be up to the coder (the one who use the Framework) to pick up some ideas and predefined style included in this Framework to build its own website.

WHY SHOULD WE DO THIS PROJECT?
As we are learning, I don’t think it is a good idea to try to create the new revolutionary concept, it should be good to understand how this kind of Framework works
I am a bit sad to see so many websites that look like the same, propose to include an artistic work on our website should be a good way to change the things
As we are mainly coders, sometimes it should be great to have some inspiration to build our website without focusing to much on the design (because being a web designer is a full-time job!)
HOW DO I SEE THE PROJECT?
I see a Framework, as Bootstrap, where you just have to add a class to your element to benefits of a predefined style
I think it should be good to add CSS style, but maybe JS behavior as well
It could be great to have a website too, to present the project. In this website, maybe the web designers should propose some new designs and ask to integrate them into the library (a bit like ThemeForest)
Everybody would be welcome to contribute and add new stuff to improve the creativity on the web!
HOW CAN WE ORGANIZE THE PROJECT?
First, let see if this project should interest some of you (because I have my idea, but maybe it is not what the majority of you want to do). By the way, I think it could be good to have a base to start :slight_smile:
We should begin to group together, using Slack (or anything else, if some of you know better platforms), and register to the same Repository on GitHub
Then, we should brainstorm to propose new ideas, improvements and share our point of view (we can do that on the forum as well, but I’m afraid it should quickly become hard to manage)
After that, we can define clearly where we want to go and create the documentation according to that
We will CODE!!! Yeah xD submitting pull requests, completing tasks and improving our projects :slight_smile:
WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?
Absolutely EVERYBODY!!
We will need everybody who wants to participate.

Front-End lovers to build the main part of the Framework
Back-End lovers to build the Website
UX designer to satisfy our users
Web designers for the website and adding the first themes
Drawers for the logo and all the drawings
Native Learners (English) to write in proper English
Native Learners of other languages if we want to translate
Marketer to share our projects
And I forgot many of you!
BUT THIS PROJECTS LOOKS BIG!
Yeah it is! But it won’t need to be finished in 2 months! It could be a great project we continue after that!
And don’t worry, with a good organization it will be easy to manage it. Just go step by step to complete everything :wink:

If you are interested to be a contributor, share your GitHub pseudo here and I’ll add you to the repository!!
I am waiting for your comment, is it a project that should interest you guys? What do you think about it? Do you want to collaborate?

Thanks! And I hope this project will be exciting for you :wink: I hope it should interest you!
